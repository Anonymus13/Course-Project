Data Analysis
In this repository you can find the scrip "run_analysis.R" for processing data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone, which and can be downloaded here (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip). Information about these data i described in the Codebook.md.
In general, the "run_analysis.R" script allows to organize these data and create a tidy and independent database which sumarize the mean and the standard deviations of all measurements collected by subject and activity features. This scrip however does NOT download these information, nor unzip it. Therefore, there is one single input for this scrip, and it is the directory path of the downloaded and unzip dataset (i.e. "C:\Users\Downloads\UCI HAR Dataset"). Finally, as requirement it is necessary to install the "dplyr" package, this can be done during the script interface anyways.
